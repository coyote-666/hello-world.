# hello-world.
Teaching myself to code. Learning Linux more in depth right now as well. I'm familiar with Arduinos and Raspberry pi's but always just came to Github to cut and paste code. That got old. So now i'm learning to code so I can get my hardware to do exactly what I want it to do. Who says you cant teach an old dog new tricks.
